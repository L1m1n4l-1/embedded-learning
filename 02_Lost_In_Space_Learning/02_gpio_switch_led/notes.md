## NOTES ##

Dip Switch: 
    - Controls On/Off, High/Low, 1/0, Yes/No logic & can be manipulated to review currents.

Ground (GND):
    - Zero voltage reference
    - Provides a path for electricity's return (How does this apply to electrons heading in the opposite to standard current method)

Voltage at the Common Collector (VCC): 
    - The power supply source, could be considered the 'engine' 

Pull-Down Resistor:
    - Make sure circuit behaves properly when the switch is off

No Resistor & No Ground Connection:
    -Floating Status
        * Means the electrons are confused & may cause inaccurate readings of High & Low values in your circuit

No Resistor & Connected to GND:
    - Short Circuit (Very Dangerous)

Inputs:
    - A message received byt our board
    - Could be from sensors, buttons, switches, etc.

Outputs:
    - Signals sent out by the board
    - Could be triggered by code conditions or other sensor readings (as seen in the dip switch)
