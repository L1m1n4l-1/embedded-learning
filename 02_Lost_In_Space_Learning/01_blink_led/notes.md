## NOTES ##

LED: Light Emitting Diode (Di - 2, ode - path)
    - Anode is the positive connector with the long lead (+)
    - Cathode is the ground connector with the short lead (-)

Arduino Hero naturally connects 5 volts

Good practice for wire handling:
    Always make the certain wires the same colors for safer practice
    - Black Wire: Ground wire
    - Red Wire: Live (highest voltage) wire
