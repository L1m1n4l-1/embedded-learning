# 01 - Bare-Metal C

Goals:
    - Setup toolchain and environment.
    - Practice low-level C focused on embedded (no dynamic memory at first).
    - Document what I learn from "Bare Metal C" by Steve Oualline.

Hardware:
    - TBD (Will add once I hookup my microcontroller board).

Notes:
    - This folder will contain code examples and notes as I go.
